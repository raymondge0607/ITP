# Phase 1 Documentation
- So to start off, I brainstormed a couple ideas of symbols that can easily be represented by 3 or more geometric shapes. At first I was thinking some random shape compromised of rectangles and circles but then I was taking a walk last week and I had seen the big Citgo sign at Kenmore and I knew that was the perfect shape to create since it was just three triangles together enclosed in a square. I then immediately got my iPad out and drew it on graph paper on a 100 x 100 graph. I actually searched up the official documentation file of the Citgo sign that had included the exact dimensions and angles and I realized that it was too difficult to get spot on so I just drew a simple replication of it. The initial sketch is included in the Phase 1 folder in which this markdown file is included in.
