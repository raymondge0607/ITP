# The Band Documentation
- ViskiXD.github.io
- Overall, as a group we didn't face many issues that we weren't able to figure out just from discussing with each other. One thing I would say that we did struggle with was how to attach a clickable link to text and we had figured it out with a simple google search.
- For this project, since I wasn't the one operating the main computer that we were working off of, I helped generate creative ideas about the "band" and what things we should include on this website. Additionally, I helped Misha clarify some syntax within html and how to do certain things for instance create a clickable piece of text that leads to a link, resizing the images, etc.
- Misha was the main one operating the computer in which we were working off of and he was responsible for the funny ideas across the website including the "rick roll" and the ideas of the images. Adler was responsible for providing the text, using chatGPT to ironically generate some very robotic (but heavily detailed) text about a "band"
