# Power Documentation
- The goal of this code is to write a program that prints our the graph of y=x^2 horizontally. First I started with the print_graph function and utilized a loop to iterate over the range (-8,9). For each i in the range a string of asterisks is printed. The length of each string is determined by the power of i squared.
- I then defined the get_power(x, n) function to calculate x to the power of n. 
- Lastly, I used the print_graph function with an input value of 1 to generate the graph.
