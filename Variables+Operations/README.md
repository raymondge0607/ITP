# Variables+Operations
# Assignment - Mice
- So to start off the code for the Mice assignment, I wanted to base it off of the code used for the three columns in the readme file for the variables and operations folder. I copy and pasted that code in order to maintain the "3 column" format (despite there being blanks in certain areas) to start from.
- For the number, I decided to make a simple calculation by creating 3 variables, a, b, and c. I set a equals to 1, b equals to 2, and c is the sum of a and b. Thus, when printing c, it will result in the number "3" being printed.
- To format everything together, I took the columns code, and I put "c, " right after the print command and right before the quotations (to avoid the function from just printing the letter c), and re-writing the rest of the code to "\t\t\n\tBlind\t\n\t\tMice".
- The end result code looks like this:
- a = 1
- b = 2
- c = a + b
- print(c, "\t\t\n\tBlind\t\n\t\tMice")
- The end result is:
- 3
-         Blind
-                 Mice
