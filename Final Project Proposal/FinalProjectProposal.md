# Final Project Proposal
- What will (likely) be the title of your project?
  - The title of my project will (likely) be "Audio Visualizer"

- In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project a web-based synthesizer.")
  - For my final project, I plan on programming an audio visualizer that will intake an audio source (most likely desktop audio) and create some detailed and fun ways of visualizing audio in a way that may benefit a musician's understanding of sound or literally just to have fun visuals.

- List at least 3 resources you know you will use in developing your project
  - 3 resources I know I will use in the provess of developing this project are:
    - ChatGPT to help in the process of building pseudo-code and understand python logic especially when it comes to audio inputs
    - YouTube tutorials!
    - Online forums and articles regarding audio in python, audio capture devices, libraries, etc.

- In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
  - In this project, this program will be able to take audio input from whatever device it is being run on (device and/or microphone) and will be able to visualize the EQ and/or waveform of the audio in a fun an unique way. There will be a degree of customization to the color/transparency/shape/size/type of the visualization from the user and it will act as an overlay so that the user will be able to view the audio through the program and continue doing whatever else one may intend, wheter its casually streaming music or utilizing the visualizer whilst creating music.

- In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

- In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
  - Honestly, I would be very proud just to be able to get the very basics of visualization down, whether it ends up just being like an eight-band EQ that will react to audio input or a very simple momentary waveform visualizer. I don't expect to get the audio in exact detail when it comes to the visualization but I do also want to make it unique and fun.

- In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
  - I do believe that the basic features of the visualizer (mentioned in the previous question) will be achievable before the deadline. I think the features such as having the user being able to customize the color/transparency/shape/size/type of the visualizer will be a bit more difficult. I do hope to achieve some of these customization features in at least some basic form

- In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
  - The BEST outcome is to be able to achieve a higher definition visulalizer in terms of the EQ and waveforms AND to also have a good amount of customization the color/transparency/shape/size/type of audio visualizer.

- In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps WITH A SPECIFIC CALENDAR. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?
  - Given that this final project is due on May 9th, that creates a 4 week timeline to be able to achieve this idea. Within the first week, I plan on creating an outline and finishing the pseudo-code to form a good basis to move on from. Before doing so, I'm going to research and view as many examples of similar projects using python on the internet to gather inspiration and understand where to start. By the second week, I want to be able to achieve the very basic forms of visualization as mentioned before, whether its a 4 band EQ that will be able to react to audio input. By the third week, I want to have this feature developed further and be able to capture more detail. Additionally I also want to begin brainstorming and adding UI customization features. By the fourth week, depending on how successfull my progress has been, I want to tidy up everything within the code and prepare this project for presentation for the final class.
