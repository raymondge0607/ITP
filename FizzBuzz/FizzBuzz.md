# FizzBuzz Documentation
- For the fizzbuzz program, I started off with creating a range from 1 - 101 (since it must include 100). I then created an if statment that checks if i is divisble by 3 and 5 without any remainders and if so, the program prints "FizzBuzz".
- If that first condition is not met then an elif statement will check if it is divisible by only 3 without any remainder. If true, the program will just print "Fizz".
- Lastly, if that is not met, another elif statement will check if i is only divisible by 5. If so, the program will just print "Buzz"
- If none of the conditions above are met then the program will just print the number "i".
