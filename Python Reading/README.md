# Python Reading

- In the chapter 1, "The way of the Program", one thing that I did not know before reading (and last week's class) was that there are different versions of python (1, 2, and 3) and while they are similar, they are separated by their differences in syntax. Something that DID know from this chapter was that problem solving is an essential skill to have as a computer scientist.
- In the third chapter, "Functions", one thing that I did not know before reading was the concept of "stack diagrams" and how it can be utilized to help visualize variables in code. Something that I did know before reading was the concept of functions and how you can name and recall them in order to peform certain executions.
- In the last and fifth chapter, "Conditionals and recursion", one thing that I did not know before reading was the capability of the modulus operator, %. It can be really useful in certain situations to yield a remainder from dividing two numbers rather than a decimal value. Some things that I was aware of before reading were the different ty[es of boolean expressions and their functionalities, as I have had some prior experience in computer science concepts.
